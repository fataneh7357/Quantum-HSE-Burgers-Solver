# Quantum-HSE-Burgers-Solver
The HSE framework is used in this resource-efficient quantum solver for the 1D viscous Burgers' equation. Its features include validation against traditional CFD baselines, real QPU execution with error mitigation, and noiseless/noisy simulation. The algorithm is intended for low-depth unitary evolution and minimal qubits.
